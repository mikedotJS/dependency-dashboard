# TASK_001: Circular Dependency Detection

## Overview
Implement functionality to identify and highlight circular imports in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Circular dependencies occur when two or more modules import each other, either directly or indirectly. This can lead to runtime errors, infinite loops, and maintenance issues. This task involves implementing detection and visualization of these problematic dependency patterns.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Detect direct circular dependencies (A imports B, B imports A)
- [ ] Detect indirect circular dependencies (A imports B, B imports C, C imports A)
- [ ] Generate a list of all circular dependency chains
- [ ] Highlight circular dependencies in the dashboard visualization
- [ ] Provide detailed information about each circular dependency chain
- [ ] Include file paths and line numbers where circular imports occur

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement graph traversal algorithm (DFS with cycle detection)
- [ ] Handle edge cases (self-imports, conditional imports)
- [ ] Optimize for performance on large projects
- [ ] Provide clear error messages and warnings
- [ ] Integrate with existing dependency analysis pipeline

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Add circular dependency section to dashboard
- [ ] Use visual indicators (red edges, warning icons) for circular dependencies
- [ ] Provide expandable/collapsible view of circular dependency chains
- [ ] Include severity levels (critical, warning, info)
- [ ] Add export functionality for circular dependency reports

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully detects circular dependencies in test projects
- [ ] Dashboard displays circular dependencies with clear visual indicators
- [ ] CLI provides warnings about circular dependencies
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 10% increase in analysis time)
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully without false positives

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using Tarjan's algorithm for cycle detection
- Implement caching to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files
- Provide configuration options for circular dependency tolerance levels
- Consider integration with existing linter tools (ESLint circular-dependency rule)

## Dependencies
- Existing dependency parsing infrastructure
- Dashboard visualization system
- CLI output formatting

## Estimated Effort
- Development: 3-4 days
- Testing: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
