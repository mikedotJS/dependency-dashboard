# TASK_007: Output Format Options

## Overview
Implement support for multiple output formats beyond HTML, including JSON, CSV, Markdown, and other structured formats for better integration with other tools and workflows.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Different users and use cases require different output formats. This feature will provide flexible output options to support various workflows, CI/CD integration, and data analysis needs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] JSON output for programmatic access
- [ ] CSV output for spreadsheet analysis
- [ ] Markdown output for documentation
- [ ] XML output for enterprise integration
- [ ] YAML output for configuration files
- [ ] Custom template support for specialized formats

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement output formatter abstraction layer
- [ ] Support for configurable output schemas
- [ ] Handle large datasets efficiently
- [ ] Provide output validation and error handling
- [ ] Support for output compression and streaming
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing HTML output

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Clear format selection in CLI and interactive mode
- [ ] Format-specific help and examples
- [ ] Preview functionality for output formats
- [ ] Output format validation and error reporting
- [ ] Integration with existing dashboard generation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All output formats produce accurate and complete data
- [ ] Performance impact of format generation is minimal
- [ ] Output formats are well-documented with examples
- [ ] Users can easily switch between output formats
- [ ] Custom templates can be created and used

## Implementation Notes
- Create a plugin-based architecture for output formatters
- Use streaming for large output files to manage memory usage
- Provide schema documentation for each output format
- Consider implementing output format validation
- Support for output format chaining (e.g., JSON to CSV conversion)
