# TASK_003: Unused Dependency Detection

## Overview
Implement functionality to identify modules that are imported but never actually used in the codebase.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Unused dependencies bloat the codebase, increase bundle sizes, and create maintenance overhead. This feature will analyze imports and their usage to identify dead code that can be safely removed.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Detect unused import statements
- [ ] Detect unused named exports from imported modules
- [ ] Handle different import patterns (default, named, namespace)
- [ ] Identify unused dependencies in package.json
- [ ] Provide confidence levels for unused dependency detection
- [ ] Generate removal suggestions with safety warnings

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement static code analysis for import usage tracking
- [ ] Handle dynamic imports and conditional usage
- [ ] Consider TypeScript type-only imports
- [ ] Account for side effects and implicit dependencies
- [ ] Provide configurable detection rules and thresholds
- [ ] Integrate with existing AST parsing infrastructure

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Add unused dependencies section to dashboard
- [ ] Use visual indicators (yellow warnings, red critical) for unused imports
- [ ] Provide detailed usage analysis for each unused dependency
- [ ] Include confidence scores and removal recommendations
- [ ] Add bulk removal suggestions with safety checks
- [ ] Show potential bundle size savings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Correctly identifies unused imports with high accuracy (>95%)
- [ ] Provides clear explanations for why dependencies are flagged as unused
- [ ] Handles edge cases (side effects, dynamic imports, type-only imports)
- [ ] Dashboard displays unused dependencies with actionable insights
- [ ] CLI provides clear warnings and suggestions for unused dependencies

## Implementation Notes
- Use AST traversal to track import usage across the codebase
- Consider implementing a "dry-run" mode for safe testing
- Provide configuration options for different project types
- Consider integration with tree-shaking analysis tools
- Handle false positives from complex usage patterns

## Dependencies
- Existing AST parsing infrastructure
- Dashboard visualization system
- CLI output formatting

## Estimated Effort
- Development: 3-4 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
