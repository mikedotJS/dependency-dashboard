# TASK_006: Batch Processing

## Overview
Implement functionality to analyze multiple files/folders at once, enabling efficient analysis of large projects or multiple projects simultaneously.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Batch processing allows users to analyze multiple targets (files, folders, or projects) in a single command, with options for parallel processing, unified reporting, and comparative analysis.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Analyze multiple files/folders in a single command
- [ ] Support for glob patterns and file lists
- [ ] Parallel processing for improved performance
- [ ] Unified dashboard for multiple analysis results
- [ ] Comparative analysis between different targets
- [ ] Batch-specific output formats and reports

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement worker pool for parallel processing
- [ ] Handle memory management for large batch operations
- [ ] Provide progress tracking for batch operations
- [ ] Support for batch-specific configuration options
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery for failed analyses
- [ ] Optimize for large-scale batch operations

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Progress indicators for batch operations
- [ ] Summary view of all batch results
- [ ] Individual and aggregate statistics
- [ ] Comparative visualizations between targets
- [ ] Export options for batch results
- [ ] Filtering and sorting of batch results

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully processes multiple targets in a single command
- [ ] Parallel processing provides significant performance improvements
- [ ] Batch results are clearly organized and easy to navigate
- [ ] Error handling prevents one failed analysis from stopping the entire batch
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable for large batch operations

## Implementation Notes
- Use Node.js worker threads for parallel processing
- Implement a queue system for managing batch operations
- Consider implementing batch size limits to prevent memory issues
- Provide both synchronous and asynchronous batch processing modes
- Include batch-specific configuration options

## Dependencies
- Existing analysis infrastructure
- Progress tracking system
- Dashboard generation system

## Estimated Effort
- Development: 3-4 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
