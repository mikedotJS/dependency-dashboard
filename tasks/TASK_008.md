# TASK_008: Config File Support

## Overview
Implement support for configuration files (`.dependency-dashboardrc`) to allow users to customize analysis settings, output formats, and other preferences on a per-project basis.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Configuration files will enable users to define project-specific settings, analysis rules, output preferences, and other customization options, making the tool more flexible and easier to integrate into existing workflows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Support for `.dependency-dashboardrc` configuration files
- [ ] Multiple configuration file formats (JSON, YAML, JavaScript)
- [ ] Project-level and global configuration options
- [ ] Configuration inheritance and override mechanisms
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration support
- [ ] Configuration validation and error reporting

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement configuration file parser and validator
- [ ] Support for configuration file discovery and loading
- [ ] Handle configuration file precedence and merging
- [ ] Provide configuration schema and documentation
- [ ] Support for configuration file templates
- [ ] Integration with existing CLI and analysis infrastructure

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Clear configuration file documentation and examples
- [ ] Configuration validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Configuration file generation from interactive mode
- [ ] Configuration file migration tools for version updates
- [ ] Integration with existing CLI help system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configuration files are properly loaded and applied
- [ ] Configuration validation provides clear error messages
- [ ] Configuration inheritance works correctly
- [ ] Users can easily create and modify configuration files
- [ ] Configuration changes are immediately reflected in tool behavior

## Implementation Notes
- Use a configuration management library like cosmiconfig
