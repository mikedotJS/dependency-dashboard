# TASK_009: Interactive Dependency Graph

## Overview
Transform the static dependency visualization into an interactive graph where users can click on nodes and edges to explore dependencies in detail.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Interactive dependency graphs will provide a more engaging and informative way to explore project dependencies, allowing users to drill down into specific modules, filter views, and understand complex dependency relationships.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Clickable nodes and edges in dependency graph
- [ ] Node expansion and collapse functionality
- [ ] Zoom and pan controls for large graphs
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities
- [ ] Node highlighting and selection
- [ ] Detailed information panels for selected elements

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement interactive graph using D3.js or similar library
- [ ] Handle large graphs with performance optimization
- [ ] Implement graph layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical)
- [ ] Support for different graph visualization modes
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Integration with existing dashboard infrastructure

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive navigation and interaction patterns
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for user interactions
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Accessible design with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Mobile-friendly touch interactions
- [ ] Consistent styling with existing dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can interact with graph nodes and edges
- [ ] Graph performance remains smooth with large datasets
- [ ] Interactive features enhance understanding of dependencies
- [ ] Graph is accessible and works on different devices
- [ ] Integration with existing dashboard features is seamless

## Implementation Notes
- Use D3.js or vis.js for interactive graph visualization
