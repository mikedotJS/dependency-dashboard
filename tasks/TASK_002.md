# TASK_002: Dependency Depth Analysis

## Overview
Implement functionality to analyze and visualize how deep dependency chains go in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Dependency depth analysis helps developers understand the complexity of their module dependencies by showing how many levels deep the import chains go. This is crucial for identifying potential performance issues, maintenance challenges, and architectural problems.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Calculate maximum dependency depth for each module
- [ ] Calculate average dependency depth across the project
- [ ] Identify modules with excessive dependency depth (>5 levels)
- [ ] Generate dependency depth statistics and metrics
- [ ] Provide dependency chain visualization showing depth levels
- [ ] Track both incoming and outgoing dependency depths

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement breadth-first search (BFS) for depth calculation
- [ ] Handle circular dependencies in depth calculations
- [ ] Optimize for large projects with complex dependency graphs
- [ ] Cache depth calculations to avoid recomputation
- [ ] Provide configurable depth thresholds and limits

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Add depth analysis section to dashboard
- [ ] Use color coding to indicate depth levels (green=shallow, yellow=medium, red=deep)
- [ ] Provide depth distribution charts and graphs
- [ ] Show dependency chains with depth indicators
- [ ] Include depth-based filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Add depth trend analysis over time

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Correctly calculates dependency depths for all modules
- [ ] Dashboard displays depth information with clear visual indicators
- [ ] CLI provides depth statistics and warnings for deep dependencies
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable (< 15% increase in analysis time)
- [ ] Handles edge cases (circular dependencies, missing modules)

## Implementation Notes
- Use memoization to cache depth calculations
- Consider implementing depth limits to prevent infinite recursion
- Provide both absolute and relative depth metrics
- Consider integration with bundle size analysis for depth impact assessment

## Dependencies
- Existing dependency parsing infrastructure
- Dashboard visualization system
- TASK_001: Circular dependency detection

## Estimated Effort
- Development: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Documentation: 0.5 days
