# TASK_010: Search and Filter

## Overview
Implement comprehensive search and filtering capabilities to help users quickly find specific dependencies and focus on relevant parts of the dependency graph.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Search and filter functionality will enable users to quickly locate specific modules, filter by dependency types, and focus on particular areas of interest within large dependency graphs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Real-time search across module names and paths
- [ ] Filter by dependency types (internal, external, circular)
- [ ] Filter by file extensions and patterns
- [ ] Advanced search with regex support
- [ ] Search history and saved filters
- [ ] Bulk selection and operations on filtered results

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement efficient search indexing
- [ ] Support for fuzzy search and autocomplete
- [ ] Handle large datasets with performance optimization
- [ ] Implement filter state management
- [ ] Support for complex filter combinations
- [ ] Integration with existing dashboard and graph components

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Prominent search bar with clear visual design
- [ ] Filter panel with intuitive controls
- [ ] Real-time search results with highlighting
- [ ] Clear indication of active filters
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common search operations
- [ ] Mobile-friendly search interface

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search results are accurate and relevant
- [ ] Filtering performance is acceptable for large datasets
- [ ] Search and filter state is preserved during navigation
- [ ] Users can easily clear and modify search criteria
- [ ] Search functionality integrates well with interactive graph

## Implementation Notes
- Use a lightweight search library like Fuse.js for fuzzy search
- Implement debouncing for real-time search performance
- Consider implementing search result caching
- Provide search result export functionality
- Include search analytics for improving search relevance

## Dependencies
- Existing dashboard infrastructure
- Interactive graph components
- Dependency analysis data
