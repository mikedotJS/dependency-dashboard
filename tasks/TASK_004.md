# TASK_004: Missing Dependency Detection

## Overview
Implement functionality to identify modules that are used in the code but not properly imported or declared as dependencies.

## Priority
High Priority (v1.1.0 - v1.2.0)

## Description
Missing dependencies can cause runtime errors, build failures, and deployment issues. This feature will detect when code references modules that aren't properly imported or declared in package.json, helping prevent these common issues.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Detect undefined variables that should be imports
- [ ] Identify missing dependencies in package.json
- [ ] Detect global variables that should be imported
- [ ] Find references to modules not in node_modules
- [ ] Provide import suggestions for missing dependencies
- [ ] Handle different module resolution strategies

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Implement AST analysis for undefined variable detection
- [ ] Cross-reference with package.json and node_modules
- [ ] Handle different module systems (CommonJS, ES modules)
- [ ] Consider TypeScript ambient declarations and global types
- [ ] Provide configurable detection rules and ignore patterns
- [ ] Integrate with existing dependency analysis pipeline

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Add missing dependencies section to dashboard
- [ ] Use visual indicators (red errors, orange warnings) for missing dependencies
- [ ] Provide detailed error messages with suggested fixes
- [ ] Include import statement suggestions
- [ ] Add package.json update recommendations
- [ ] Show potential runtime errors and their locations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Correctly identifies missing dependencies with high accuracy (>90%)
- [ ] Provides actionable suggestions for fixing missing dependencies
- [ ] Handles edge cases (global variables, ambient declarations, dynamic imports)
- [ ] Dashboard displays missing dependencies with clear error indicators
- [ ] CLI provides clear error messages and fix suggestions

## Implementation Notes
- Use AST analysis to identify undefined variables and references
- Cross-reference with existing imports and package.json dependencies
- Consider implementing auto-fix functionality for simple cases
- Provide configuration options for different project setups
- Handle false positives from legitimate global variables and types

## Dependencies
- Existing AST parsing infrastructure
- Dashboard visualization system
- CLI output formatting

## Estimated Effort
- Development: 3-4 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 0.5 days
